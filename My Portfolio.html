        <h1 style="font-size:35px;">My Background:</h1>
        <p>When I was growing up I lived in a small town in Eastern Washington. Shortly after I turned 11; I moved to the <strong><i>Greater Seattle Area</i></strong>, and I've been here ever since.<br />
        Around 6 years old is when I obtained my first gaming console; which was the Playstation One. That Playstation is what made me grow into the <strong><ins><em>big boi</em></ins></strong> gamer I am today.<br /> When growing up in Eastern Washington there isn't a lot to do, The list of things you can do is very limited.
    That list would include <ul>
        <li>Hanging out with friends.</li>
        <li>longboarding to the store.</li>
        <li>Hiking.</li>
        <li>Playing in the backyard.</li>
    </ul>If it was too hot to be outside then I would stay inside in the basement where it was <strong><em>chilled</em></strong> compared to outside; and play videogames with my brother and relax.<br />I have two older siblings. The eldest of the 2 is my Sister; she is 28 years old, The middle child is my Brother; he is 26 years old, then there is me at 23 years old.<br />
While both of my siblings have helped me throught a lot; it doesn't compare to my parents who are so incredibly kind and have helped me through a lot of the difficulties i've had through my life.<br /> My job background is scattered due to me having around 10 jobs in the past 7 years. A lot of those jobs had to do with customer service and problem solving so I gained a lot of skills through out the years.</p>

            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Golfing</strong></li>
                        <div>I started golfing about a year and a half ago. It is the most frustraiting, but also the most satisfying sport i've ever played.</div>
                        <div>My older brother is the one who first got me started playing golf. Golf has been a way for me to connect with my brother and bond with him.</div>                                       
                    <li><strong>Photography</strong></li>
                        <div>When I was 13 is when I started taking photos and taking photography classes. I fell in love with photography almost instantly.</div>
                        <div>After a few years of doing photography I developed the eye for what a good photo looks like; and what a bad photo is lacking.</div>
                        <div>Photography to me is being able to capture moments in time and be able to "time travel" to see the world from a past me.</div>
                    <li><strong>Camping</strong></li>
                        <div>When I go camping it's always some sort of road trip with my dad and we take a break from technology.</div>
                        <div>It helps us slow down in life and enjoy our surroundings.</div>
                    <li><strong>Gaming</strong></li>
                        <div>Gaming has been a way for me to escape the craziness of life and to explore new stories, characters, and helps my mind to relax.</div>
                        <div>I always game with my older brother and that's one way we stay connected and communicate</div>

        <h1 style="font-size:35px;">Why I want to do <strong><ins>Web Developing</ins></strong></h1>
        <p>Honestly I want to become a Web Developer to have a stable career. In the past I worked at <em>Microsoft</em> but I didn't have the skills necessary to stay there and continue my contract.<br />By joining this course and gaining the knowledge needed to progress in this vast and growing tech industry I decided to learn code/web development.
        So I am excited to learn more, and join this growing community.<br /> For the past 7 almost 8 years i've been working <q><ins>dead-end</ins></q>,<em>low-paying</em> jobs. So being able to have a stable career that pays enough to live off of, as well as able to help out my parents financially too which is a goal of mine. </p>
